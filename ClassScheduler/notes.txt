So these are temporary notes for now. If project looks promising I will try to 
write up a proper spec.

Idea is we are going to create an OO implementations of a university class system
where classes have pre-reqs and co-reqs. 

There will also be the idea that there are majors / minors that have specific 
requirments. 

Idea that peaple can take classes

People can select courses they would like to take. And it will try to build a
schedule around these courses, and let them know if there are any requirments for
there major or minor that they have not completed.
